We are excited to share with this community AWE’s new report, “Gender Integration in USAID’s Agricultural Research Investments: A Synthesis of Key Findings and Best Practices.” The report summarizes the extent and nature of gender integration across 20 agricultural and food security research activities funded by the USAID’s Bureau for Food Security, including 16 Feed the Future Innovation Labs. The report focuses on four broad themes and explores key project documents, an in-person workshop, and key informant interviews with 38 research directors, gender advisors, and other activity staff. Explore the infographic below to discover key findings and best practices from the report.
