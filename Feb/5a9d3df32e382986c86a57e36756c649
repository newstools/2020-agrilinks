Resilience – the ability to manage through crisis without compromising future wellbeing – is increasingly recognized as an essential part of global development. Droughts, flooding, and other shocks and crises threaten food security and the livelihoods of millions of farmers. As a changing climate makes extreme weather events more intense and unpredictable, it is more imperative than ever that we understand how to effectively build the resilience of individuals, communities, and markets. That’s why we’re excited to announce the launch of ResilienceLinks, a new global knowledge platform for resilience practitioners. With resources and event announcements from USAID as well as other donors and implementers, ResilienceLinks is a premier source of information coordinating with and complementing other platforms. The platform features: To build global resilience, we need resilience practitioners around the world to share learning and knowledge around global resilience. We need evidence and data on what works and why it works so that we can efficiently, effectively, and quickly meet the pressing need to build global resilience. We need to know what works best in a given context and how to adapt that approach to other contexts. We already have a knowledge base that includes many important findings, such as: Every day, we are learning more about what works best in building global resilience, and your contributions are essential to continuing to build this evidence base. Head over to ResilienceLinks and explore the resources, country profiles, and topics, and contribute your own resources and events!
