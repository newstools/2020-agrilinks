The Intra-African Agriculture Trade Improvement Scorecards, a resource set from the Feed the Future Enabling Environment for Food Security project, reveal comparative performance on elements central to a functioning trade system. By linking publicly available data to key trade determinants, the Trade Improvement Scorecards identify areas that can strengthen the trading system at the country and regional levels across sub-Saharan Africa. With recent progress toward ratifying the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, this analysis is especially timely. In the June 2014 Malabo Declaration, heads of state of African Union member countries committed to a series of measurable goals related to agriculture-led growth and food security on the continent, including tripling intra-African agricultural trade by 2025. In 2018, the Regional Strategic Analysis and Knowledge Support System issued a report on performance against this indicator. While overall trade increases were observed continent-wide, performance among countries varied considerably. The Malabo Declaration targets are country-owned and align closely with the U.S. Government’s Global Food Security Strategy. Increased trade can open up new markets and build resilience against food system shocks. Addressing constraints identified in the Trade Improvement Scorecards can help harness intra-African trade for improved food security outcomes.
