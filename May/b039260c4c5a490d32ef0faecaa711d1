This post is based on a new learning paper, “Lessons from Farming Households: Agricultural Decision Making and Shifting Social Norms for Women’s Economic Empowerment,” published as part of the MEDA INNOVATE learning series. Decisions that smallholder women and men make within their households are not influenced by productivity gains and cost-savings alone. It is well understood in agricultural development and financial inclusion efforts that rural women face compounded socio-cultural and economic barriers in accessing training, information, finance, land, and other assets critical to achieving success in agriculture-related enterprises. In many developing countries, women represent 40-50 percent of the agricultural labor force and play vital roles in transforming rural economies, yet they continue to face barriers at the household, community, and national levels in building resilient livelihoods. Through a three-year initiative funded by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), MEDA’s INNOVATE initiative partnered with ten organizations in South Asia, South America, and East Africa to assess the potential of non-traditional finance to enable large scale adoption of agricultural innovations among women and men smallholder farmers. INNOVATE’s new learning paper, “Lessons from Farming Households: Agricultural Decision Making and Shifting Social Norms for Women’s Economic Empowerment,” explores how decisions are made within agricultural households around production, including the adoption and uptake of new practices or inputs along with savings, credit, and insurance products. Author Larissa Schneider (MEDA) highlights examples from the INNOVATE portfolio that demonstrate the importance of working with partners to encourage greater engagement by women in agriculture and finance through increased decision-making over production. Estimates suggest that if the gender gap in agriculture closes, yields on women-run farms could increase by 20-30 percent, effectively raising agricultural outputs in developing countries by 2.5-4 percent and leading to both increased and sustained livelihoods for millions of farming families. Therefore, it is critical for those working in women’s economic empowerment programming to consider the impacts of a constrained enabling environment, as well as socio-cultural barriers such as traditional or harmful social norms, on the differential access women and other underserved populations may have to the important drivers of financial inclusion in agriculture––education, entrepreneurship, employment opportunities, and financial services.
