In this video about a Fish Innovation Lab quick start project, U.S. PI Julius Nukpezah and U.S. co-PI Joe Steensma discuss their team's project in Nigeria focused on research to improve post-harvest loss in the fish value chain. "We are seeking to understand the post-harvest losses that occur as fish travel along the chain from production to processing to transportation to consumption," said Nukpezah.  This project includes identifying technologies and practices that provide income growth and improve diets; identifying and mapping the aquaculture market systems that improve productivity and reduce post-harvest losses of aquaculture fish; and identifying gaps in the aquaculture post-harvest sector. This work will build on available data from public- and private-sector partners in addition to mapping the aquaculture value chain in Nigeria to better understand the current aquaculture post-harvest chain structure, efficiency, and key market constraints.
