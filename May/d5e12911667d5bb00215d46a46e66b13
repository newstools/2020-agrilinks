Approximately 2 billion rural people live in small farm households. Each year, emergencies compromise many of their livelihoods. Practitioners, policymakers, and communities have a wealth of experience about which approaches for agricultural assistance are effective (or not) in emergencies. To date, this evidence has not been reviewed. A new project has been launched to review the evidence and fill this knowledge gap, similar to the way other humanitarian standards have filled the gaps in other fields. The SEADS Project will use evidence and experience to develop standards through a multi-year, inclusive, and consultative process. The resulting SEADS standards will enable those responding to humanitarian crises to design, implement, and evaluate agricultural interventions to maintain and strengthen agriculture livelihoods, increase resiliency, and support preparedness and post-emergency recovery. The SEADS project will incorporate input and feedback from a broad number of stakeholders including crisis-affected farming communities, local NGOs, international NGOs, civil society, governments in affected countries, UN agencies, and international donors. It will follow an objective and transparent process to ensure that the standards articulate the best available evidence on the most common agricultural interventions in emergencies. The project is managed and supported by a steering group currently made up of Catholic Relief Services, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Livestock Emergency Guidelines and Standards (LEGS), SOS Sahel Sudan, World Vision, and the Feinstein International Center at Tufts University School of Nutrition. Although the project has just begun, there are many ways for humanitarian and agriculture experts to get involved. Here are just a few:
