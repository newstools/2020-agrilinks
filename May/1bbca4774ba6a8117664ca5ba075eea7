In this video, researchers from the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Fish discuss their work in Kenya. Kenya PI Andrew Wamukota and U.S. PI Lora Iannotti discuss a project in Kenya that focused on research to improve nutrition (especially for young children) in households through the sustainable provision of fish. "What we would hope is that there will be some empowerment and a creation of awareness from both men and women, so that they can understand the importance of investing in the future now," said Wamukota.  This project includes identifying nutritious coastal marine fish for food that maintain ecosystem functioning; assessing the acceptability and feasibility of these fish as foods for nourishing vulnerable populations of pregnant and lactating women, as well as young children; and determining market conditions for ensuring availability, affordability, and safety of these coastal marine fish as food. The research will provide a comprehensive inventory of coastal marine fish for food that maintain ecosystem functioning and address micronutrient deficiencies in vulnerable groups and yield insights into current household fish consumption and social dynamics in low-income households.
