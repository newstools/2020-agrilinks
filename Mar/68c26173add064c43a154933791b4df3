USAID has issued a Request for Information (RFI) to collect expressions of interest from organizations, particularly non-traditional partners, that can potentially support research and development in the area of animal health. The purpose of this market research exercise is to provide supplemental information during the co-creation process for the Animal Health APS (No. 7200APS20APS00001). USAID anticipates that the Animal Health Innovation Lab will be a consortium of partners working collaboratively to support research, development, and dissemination of animal health interventions as well as Human and Institutional Capacity Development (HICD). Consortium partners may include private sector entities, public sector entities, civil society, local partners, Consultative Group of International Agriculture Research (CGIAR), National Agriculture Research System (NARS), and NGOs from the US or abroad. Responses to this RFI will be made available to eligible principal applicants of the Animal Health APS, who may, or may not, contact respondents directly to discuss opportunities to partner with interested organizations in a consortium-style program.
