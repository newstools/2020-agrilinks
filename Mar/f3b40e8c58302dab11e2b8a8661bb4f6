The Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Crop Improvement collaborates with local scientists and national agricultural research institutes in East and West Africa, South Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean to develop resilient crop varieties of roots, tubers, banana, legumes, sorghum and millets that can produce higher yields, enhance nutrition and show greater resistance to pests and diseases. The Innovation Lab applies science, technology and innovation to make healthy food more accessible, stable, and gender- and market-responsive around the globe. We seek to partner with National Agricultural Research Institutes (NARI) to identify, develop, pilot and transfer appropriate tools, technologies and methods (TTMs), equipping them to deliver increased genetic gain and new products.
