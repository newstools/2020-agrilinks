USAID's U.S. Global Development Lab is seeking concept notes to establish a Development Impact Science Corps (DISC) which will build the professional capabilities of scientists and technical experts to promote evidence-based policies and practices, and advance innovative solutions to development challenges. Activities under this Addendum to the Science, Technology, Innovation, and Partnership Annual Program Statement (STIP APS) will achieve two overarching objectives: 1) Generate a corps of scientists, engineers, and technical experts trained in international development programming and policy; and 2) Improve development outcomes by integrating scientific and technical expertise across USAID programming. The deadline to submit Concept Notes is April 6. Additional information on how to apply and requirements can be found here.
