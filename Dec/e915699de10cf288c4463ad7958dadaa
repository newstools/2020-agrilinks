The Innovative Methods and Metrics for Agriculture and Nutrition Actions (IMMANA) programme based at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine has launched the Call for Applications for Round 4 of our IMMANA Competitive Research Grants – our final round of funding! Grants will be provided to research projects aimed at accelerating the development of innovative and interdisciplinary methods, metrics and tools to advance the scientific understanding of the linkages between agriculture and food systems and health and nutrition outcomes, in order to better inform policy and programmatic actions to improve nutrition outcomes in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Each IMMANA grant will be a maximum of £250,000 and up to 8 grants (4 development and 4 validation) are expected to be awarded through a competitive selection process. Concept notes are required and due on 21 January 2021.
