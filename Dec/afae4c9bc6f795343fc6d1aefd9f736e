2020 will be one for the history books. It has been a year of both tremendous challenge and growth. In the midst of a global pandemic and worldwide reckoning with social injustice, there has also been creative innovation, communal adaptation, and more inclusive research. It’s worth reflecting on just how far we’ve come. This year, the Agrilinks community has shared unique solutions to unprecedented challenges and inspiring stories of people persevering against the odds to fight food insecurity. Standouts from the Agrilinks community include a case for how women's empowerment in agriculture is essential to COVID-19 survival and recovery, an exploration of how an innovative storage technique can be life-changing, an argument for why agroecological farming is key to a sustainable future, and how traceability systems relate to food safety issues. This month, we want to thank you for all of the work you’ve done — and we want to hear from you! What have you learned in 2020?
