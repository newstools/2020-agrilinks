This November, Agrilinks will explore the importance of pollinators to food security and nutrition. A diversity of wild and managed pollinators — including birds, butterflies, bats, and bees — enable crop fertilization and reproduction for over 75 percent of leading food crops. Pollinator-dependent crops contribute significantly to human nutrition and food security, livelihoods, and sustainable economic growth. Pollinators are declining in diversity and abundance globally due to several interacting threats such as habitat loss, pesticide misuse, climate change, invasive species, and pests and pathogens. Population declines are expected to limit the provision of pollination services and have spurred increased international and national attention on pollinator conservation. Understanding the impacts of pollinator decline on food security and nutrition, and identifying successful strategies to conserve pollinators, is important to ensuring the long-term sustainability of food systems. We encourage individuals in the Agrilinks community with relevant research, field projects, and case studies to submit content for pollinator month. Please join us in coming together for a greater understanding of the critical role of pollinators in achieving global food security and nutrition goals and exploring strategies to conserve pollinators and ensure a food secure future.
