Have you and your colleagues ever debated which agriculture interventions you should do in an emergency? Did you consider which intervention will have the greatest impact on smallholder farmers’ livelihoods? How did you figure it out? Probably not easily and without much evidence because our field doesn’t have standards yet. The SEADS Project is changing this! We are developing international standards that will help you assess, design, implement, and evaluate agriculture interventions to maintain and strengthen the livelihoods of smallholder farming communities before and during emergencies.  This guide will make your decisions easier in the next emergency, but we need your help to develop it. Have you worked on a project that had a positive impact on agricultural livelihoods in an emergency?  Send evaluations, reviews, assessments, and other project documentation to coordinator@seads-standards.org. We will share your evidence with the people who are currently (through October 2020) reviewing all the evidence we can find as the first step in creating the standards. For this project, evidence includes evaluations, reviews, assessments, and other project documentation that show clear evidence of impact on livelihoods, markets, or systems. For example, we are seeking evidence that shows how a seed distribution improved access to food or income, not a report on how many people received seeds. Evidence should focus on interventions that: Note that SEADS is not looking for evidence on forestry, livestock, or fishery interventions. Please submit evidence to coordinator@seads-standards.org. Thank you in advance for your contributions and stay tuned for more opportunities to help shape the SEADS Standards.
