Animal Source Foods (ASF) have an important role to play in inclusive, resilient, and nutrition-sensitive development. In July 2020, Land O’Lakes Venture37 conducted a pulse survey with 66 value-chain actors from four countries across three continents. The survey included a variety of participants in the ASF market system in Rwanda, Mozambique, Bangladesh, and Georgia, including farmers, processors, agro-input retailers and banks. The goal was to understand the ASF market disruption caused by COVID-19 to inform current and future work. The work here represents a strategy to understand COVID-19 market distortions and disruptions in the competitiveness and resiliency of the ASF supply chain. Our data shows that as COVID-19 continues to disrupt countries around the world, food security and livelihoods are at risk. Prior to COVID-19, roughly a third of the world’s population was not getting a correct balance of nutrition. And because of COVID-19, the United Nations reports that an additional 130 million people will fall into the status of ‘food insecure.’  Access to affordable, safe and nutritious ASF – such as eggs, fish, meat, dairy products – is critical to reduce stunting and adequately feed global communities, as well as build resilience and create economic stability. Development organizations, agribusinesses and private sector partners must adapt to COVID-19 by building more resilient livestock food systems to cost-effectively supply these nutrient-dense foods. But how? We are turning to data and local insights to help us navigate a way forward.
