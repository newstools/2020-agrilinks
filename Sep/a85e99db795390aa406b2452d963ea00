USAID’s Bureau for Resilience and Food Security (RFS) is excited to announce the upcoming roll out of the Feed the Future (FTF) reporting module within USAID's Development Information Solution (DIS). Beginning this fall with FY2020 results, FTF reporting will now be done within a module of DIS and not through the Feed the Future Monitoring System (FTFMS). FTF programming and reporting remains strong and as important as ever. This transition will help RFS increase reporting efficiency over the long-term. DIS is a web-based Agency-wide portfolio management system designed to capture one cohesive development story. DIS helps to standardize data collection and reporting processes, while facilitating information-sharing across USAID. Once fully deployed, DIS will meet the need for high quality, real-time data by integrating program funding, award information, and development results in one single platform to inform evidence-based decision making. For IPs, DIS will enable smoother reporting across activities and geographies, where applicable. Feed the Future will host training sessions for both IPs and USAID Mission/OU staff between Oct. 13-22, followed by open office hours the last week of October to assist stakeholders on-demand.
