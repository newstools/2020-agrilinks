This seminar will examine how changes in global food trade since the pandemic have impacted African food systems, regional supply chains and food access. Presenters will discuss the potential long-term risks of trade disruptions for nutrition and economic growth, and identify recovery policies that governments can prioritize to strengthen food security, regional supply chains and livelihoods. The speakers will consider the social, political and logistical barriers to trade across the continent in the face of COVID-19, the challenges of equitably distributing the benefits of trade, and tradeâ€™s role in building back better.
